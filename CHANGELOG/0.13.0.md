- make it possible to define recursion schemes on directly-recursive types
- type parameters and implicits have changed all over the place.
- standard folds and unfolds on {Co}Free have changed behavior
- many operations that were previously defined specifically for `Free` and `Cofree` are no longer necessary, here are their new representations:
  - `attributeAna(a)(f)` => `ana(a)(attributeCoalgebra(f))`
  - `intepretCata(t)(f)` => `cata(t)(recover(f))`
  - `freeAna(a)(f)` => `ana(a)(f)`
  - `cofCata(t)(f)` => `cata(t)(f)`
  - `cofCataM(t)(f)` => `cataM(t)(f)`
- also makes `CorecursiveOps` (like `embed`) work even when the outer value is a subtype of the functor
